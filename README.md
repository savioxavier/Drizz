# Drizz

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Drizz is a simple Weather App made using [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) which uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch weather results for a specific city/town
